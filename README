This is a multifilament coil optimization code developed by Luquant Singh and Thomas Kruger at the University of Wisconsin, HSX Laboratory.

Input files: wout, .focus, .input, .alpha 
wout file is used to load in boundary and axis and toroidal flux on boundary
Convert HDF5 file to NetCDF file using nccopy -3 <HDF5_File> <NetCDF_File.nc>
.input file sets all variables and options, of course
.alpha file gives alpha modes
sample input files are provided 

main method found in multi.c file

First step is optimizing for alphas and leaving coil aspect ratio, centroids, and currents constant
optimizing for more parameters coming after summer, unless we are productive

Initial optimization method will be either steepest descent (which is garbage) or some easy to impliment trust region method that does not require backtracking like Conjugate gradient (I think this is the right one)

Before PPPL goals:
produce the alpha = 0 filaments
plot the filaments, and finite build with python script

To compile with gcc: "gcc multi.c -o xmulti -lm"
To compile with netcdf: " gcc load_wout.c -I$NETCDF_HOME/include -L$NETCDF_HOME/lib -lnetcdf -lm -o xread

We will worry about linking other files when they are completed

This is a multifilament coil optimization code developed by Luquant Singh and Thomas Kruger at the University of Wisconsin, HSX Laboratory.

Input files: wout, .focus, .input 
wout file is used to load in boundary and axis
.focus file gives coil centroid locations, total number of coils, currents, lengths, mode amplitudes
.input file sets all variables and options, of course
sample input files are provided 

main method found in multi.c file

First step is optimizing for alphas and leaving coil aspect ratio and centroids constant
optimizing for more parameters coming after summer, unless we are productive

Before PPPL goals:
produce the alpha = 0 filaments
plot the filaments with python script

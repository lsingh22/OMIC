This is a multi-filament coil optimization code developed primarily by Luquant Singh and Thomas Kruger at the University of Wisconsin, HSX Laboratory.

Input files: FOCUS-formatted output file (for initial filament positions), text file "<prefix>.input" with formatted input.
Output files: multi-filament and single-filament positions, rotation profile, B-field and errors on boundary for filament/multi-filament sets

To convert FOCUS output from .h5 -> .nc, use nccopy <path-to-existing-h5> <path-to-new-nc>.

---------------USAGE--------------

In a directory containing focus.output NetCDF file, execute

   ./OMIC <prefix-for-inputfile>

to write a prefix.output and prefix.mcoils file. The .output file is a NetCDF formatted file containing relevant parameters in the optimization, and the .mcoils file is a text file containing the coil positions.

   ex.) "./OMIC hsx_coils > log" will read in hsx_coils.input and focus.output from the active directory, and write hsx_coils.output and hsx_coils.mcoils to the same directory.
    
    
---------INPUT PARAMETERS----------

   case_alpha (int): determines how coils initially rotate with respect to local basis
   0- coils initialized with chosen local basis
   1- coils displaced uniformly by alp_const from local basis
   2- initial coil rotation profile read in from previous omic output file

   NFalpha (double): spectral resolution of the rotation optimization function

   alp_const (double): the initial uniform rotation for use with case_alpha = 1

   isStellSym (int): determines if stellarator symmetry enforced
   0- no stell sym
   1- stell sym

   Nseg (int): number of segments per filament in coil

   weight_field (double): weighting on normal field error objective function
   
   weight_comp (double): weighting on coil complexity objective function

   nvals_scaling (double): complexity weighting beta value (see 2020 JPP paper)

   Nradfil (int): number of filaments along "radial" direction of winding pack

   Ntorfil (int): number of filaments along "toroidal" direction of winding pack
   
   len_rad (double): dimension corresponding with Nradfil

   len_tor (double): dimension corresponding with Ntorfil

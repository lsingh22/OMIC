//This function will take the modes that define the centroid of the coils and will take the alpha vectors and the axis information
//This code will construct the XYZ points for the multifilaments and will return these XYZ points so that they can be plotted
//
//Construct the axis from fourier series
//
//Descritize axis
//
//Find closest axis point to coil center (defined by n=0 mode)
//
//Use this point to
